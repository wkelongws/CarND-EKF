###  Algorithm details

* This project is built in Oo style following the sample pipeline provided by Udacity
* The first measurements are used to initialize the state vectors, and covariance matrices are initialized to
`1, 0, 0, 0,
0, 1, 0, 0,
0, 0, 1000, 0,
0, 0, 0, 1000;`
* Upon receiving a measurement after the first, the algorithm predicts object position to the current timestep and then update the prediction using the new measurement. If the measurements of both x and y position are zero, the update step will be skipped.
* The algorithm uses different update functions based on the type of measurements (LIDAR or radar).
